## Purpose of study

## Data describtion<br>
In this project, a CNC milling machine was used to perform machining experiments. The CNC machine recorded machining data for different settings of tool condition, feed rate, and clamping pressure. More details about the dataset can be found here.<br>
The CNC machine had 4 motors (X, Y, Z axes and spindle) that generated time series data with a 100 ms interval in 18 machining experiments. The output of each experiment showed the tool condition (whether the tool was worn or not) and the result of visual inspection. This dataset is useful for finding tool wear or poor clamping.
